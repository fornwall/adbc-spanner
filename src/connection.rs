//! The [`SpannerConnection`] — an ADBC connection backed by a Spanner [`DatabaseClient`].
//!
//! ## Transactions
//!
//! By default the connection is in **autocommit** mode: every statement runs in its own Spanner
//! transaction (a single-use read-only transaction for queries, a read/write transaction for DML).
//!
//! Setting the `adbc.connection.autocommit` option to `false` begins **manual** transaction mode.
//! Because Spanner's client only exposes read/write transactions through a closure-based runner
//! (there is no public begin/commit handle), the driver implements manual transactions by
//! *buffering* DML statements — and the insert **mutations** of any bulk ingest — and applying the
//! whole batch atomically in a single read/write transaction on [`Connection::commit`] — which
//! also makes the retry-on-abort safe, since the buffer is simply replayed.
//! [`Connection::rollback`] discards the buffer.
//!
//! Consequences of this model, which callers should be aware of:
//! - In manual mode, `execute_update` on DML returns `None` (the affected-row count is not known
//!   until commit).
//! - DML with a `THEN RETURN` clause is rejected in manual mode: it must run via `ExecuteSql` to
//!   produce its rows, but buffered DML is applied through `ExecuteBatchDml` (which does not
//!   support `THEN RETURN`) — and the rows would be unobtainable at commit time anyway.
//! - **No read-your-writes:** queries (`execute`) always run immediately in a fresh single-use
//!   read-only snapshot, so a query does not observe DML buffered earlier in the same manual
//!   transaction — an `INSERT` followed by a `SELECT COUNT(*)` returns the *pre-insert* count.
//!   Commit first if a statement needs to see earlier writes.
//! - **DML and DDL reorder:** DDL also runs immediately (DDL is never transactional in Spanner),
//!   so DDL issued after buffered DML executes before it.
//! - **Ingest mutations apply at commit time:** a buffered bulk ingest's insert mutations are
//!   applied by Spanner as part of the commit itself — after every buffered DML statement in the
//!   transaction has executed, regardless of issue order — so DML in the same transaction cannot
//!   observe the ingested rows.
//! - A **failed** commit keeps the buffer and the transaction open: the caller can retry
//!   [`Connection::commit`] (replaying the batch) or [`Connection::rollback`] to discard it. The
//!   same holds when re-enabling autocommit fails to commit the buffer: the connection stays in
//!   manual mode. On `ABORTED` (the retriable code preserved in `vendor_code`) the failed attempt
//!   is guaranteed not to have committed, so the replay is exact; after an *ambiguous* transport
//!   failure the usual Spanner caveat applies — the commit may have landed, so a replay can apply
//!   the batch twice unless the DML is idempotent.
